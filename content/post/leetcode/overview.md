## 从这几个地方找题做

- https://zxi.mytechroad.com/blog/leetcode-problem-categories/
- 在https://azukiyui.com/post/leetcode/todo/ 有需要复习的题
- 在https://azukiyui.com/post/leetcode/toread/ 有需要看的视频和文章

## 做过的可以归类的题

- Edit Distance
  - [LC72](../lc72)
- 树的遍历
  - Iteration：前中后序都用stack辅助，后序还需要dequeue
  - 按层遍历：用queue
